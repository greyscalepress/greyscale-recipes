# What's this?

These are my recipes for [AutoPkg](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg).

# Installation

Just run:

    $ autopkg repo-add https://github.com/greyscalepress/greyscale-recipes.git

Which of course requires that you have [AutoPkg installed](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg/wiki/Getting-Started).
